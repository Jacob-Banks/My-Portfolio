                    Until the pandemic hit, I was living and working in Prague. I ended out there after four
                    unsatisfying frustrating and disappointing years at Carleton. I did not know what I wanted to do and
                    kept switching majors, nothing seemed to fit. In my 5th year at Carleton I came into a bit of money
                    and was dealing with a medical issue. I decided that I would travel for a year and try to sort
                    things out. However with some luck at the risky business of day trading, the one year stretched out
                    to four.

                    I decided to settle In Prague. I have dual Canadian Czech citizenship, and the cost of living there
                    is enticing. I took a course in teaching English as a second language. I managed to make enough of a
                    living doing part time private English instruction to continue traveling. Then the pandemic hit. I
                    managed to return to Canada just as everything locked down.

                <p class="para"> Bored at my parents house and feeling bad for my Grandmother locked up in a retirement
                    home, I decided I would create a website for her to see photos, of the grandchildren she never gets
                    to see. I followed that up by
                    trying my hand at a simple game to help my nephew learn his letters. I realized that I actually
                    enjoyed the kind of puzzling out of
                    problems required by writing and debugging code. I was hooked, and decided to do some more formal
                    training in order to start a career as a full stack developer!
